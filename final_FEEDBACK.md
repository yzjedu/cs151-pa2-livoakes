### Comments on the grading
- If there are NOs in this FEEDBACK document, address it according to the description
- We have not used while true, dictionary and listed in this course. It feels like you have copied this code from somewhere else, or you have used AI to generate this code. If you can prove to me that you have written this code by yourself, then I can upgrade your grade. 
- Although you have used so many functions in your program, it is not reflected in the design algorithms file
