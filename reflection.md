* Full Name :  Liv Oakes
* Student ID:  1902495

1. Objective:
   1. What were you supposed to learn/accomplish? 
      1. How to use multiple while loops and functions within a program, as well as incorporating a random function/user.
2. Procedure:
   1. What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?
      1. First I read the readme file to make sure i fully understood the program, and then continued on by making an algorithm. 
         After making the algorithm I went back and made some improvements on it before turning it into a program. after programming 
         I created a flowchart.
   2. What were the Key concepts explored?
      1. how to correctly use loops and functions
3. Results:
   1. Did your results match what you expected to get?
      1. Yes, my results matched what I expected to get.
4. Reflection:
   1. What challenges did you encounter?
      1. At first I was struggling with how to make each thing into its own function.
   2. How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?
      1. I followed the first 3 rules of programming by designing my program first with an algorithm, and then turning it into code, 
         and finally testing it to make sure it runs correctly and then fixing any errors.	
   3. Did you overcome them, and how?
      1. Yes, I was able to overcome the problems I encountered by going back and rereading my code to make sure everything
         was correct and making any changes I needed to. I also was able to use my lecture notes to help me solve the problems 
         I was facing.
   4. Any key takeaways?
      1. I found that reviewing the lecture notes about loops and functions helped a lot when I was experiencing challenges.
   5. Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?
      1. Yes, I definitely think I learned what I was supposed to for this kab and I really enjoyed completing it as well.
   6. What was it like working by yourself?
      1. I enjoyed working by myself, however I do enjoy working with a partner incase I have a question about something 
         that they would be able to answer or help me with because I did find this lab to be somewhat challenging compared
         to the others.
